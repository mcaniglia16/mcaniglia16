This summer, I joined Amazon's Alexa organization, where I implemented features for the calendar team. My focus was adding feature support for a prototype device, which is set to launch by the end of the year.

I recently joined a brand new startup called Centro Commerce. Centro is an ecommerce platform that allows businesses to better manage their inventory and orders. The platform has native integrations with Shopify and thus provides store owners accurate numbers which allows them to make better decisions for their businesses.
